<b>COMS40115 Exercise 3: Code Coverage (Week 5)</b>
<p>
<blockquote> This exercise introduces you to the Code Coverage viewer of the Riviera
  simulator. It is assumed that you have done the Simulator Tutorial exercise
  and hence know how to run Riviera without collecting code coverage.
<p>
  If there are problems, please let me know. Have fun! <br> 
  Kerstin

<p>
<b>Collecting Code Coverage</b>
<p>
<ol><li> Set up your library as usual. Compile your testbench. When initializing
  the simulation: Click the Options button. Select the Code Coverage tab. Tick
  Enable. You get best results if you tick Cover every instance separately. The
  default output directory for coverage data is the <code>coverage/</code>
  subdirectory of the current working directory. If the output directory does
  not exist, it is created automatically when coverage results are saved. You
  can also set the coverage results output directory to a different directory
  at this stage. By default, coverage results are written to a file named
  <code>results.ccl</code>; this file is the top-level file of the coverage results
  files.  Press OK, and don't forget to initialize the simulation. (Changes
  will only become effective at the next initialization.)<li> Run the simulation.<li> Under View, select the Code Coverage option. The Riviera Code Coverage
  Viewer window opens. Under File, click Open. Now open the <code>results.ccl</code>
  file in the output directory for coverage data (either the default directory
  or the one you've specified). You can investigate the testbench structure
  (click on a module) and see the total code coverage of this module as well as
  a detailed analysis of which lines have been executed.

<b>How well have you exercised the calc1 design?</b>
<p>
<p>
Part of the 2nd assignment is to find out how well the test suites you
submitted for the first assignment exercised the calc1 design.
<p>
The source code of calc 1 is now available at
<code>/usr/local/vsimsa/vlib/calc1_black_box/src</code> on any of our systems
(solaris and linux in 2.11, 2.10 and 2.16). Run your tests and measure code
coverage.
